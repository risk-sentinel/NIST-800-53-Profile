    Determine if:
      AC-04(22) access is provided from a single device to computing platforms, applications, or data that reside in multiple different security domains while preventing information flow between the different security domains.

    Assessment methods and objects:
      EXAMINE: Information flow enforcement policy; procedures addressing information flow enforcement; system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records
      INTERVIEW: Organizational personnel with information flow enforcement responsibilities; system/network administrators; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities
      TEST: Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement functions
  CHECK
  desc 'fix', <<~FIX
    NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 and SP 800-53A Rev 5 publish no remediation text for this control. Implement the control statement above, record the implementation statement in the SSP, and replace this text with the system-specific remediation once the control is automated.
  FIX
  desc 'guidance', <<~GUIDANCE
    The system provides a capability for users to access each connected security domain without providing any mechanisms to allow users to transfer data or information between the different security domains. An example of an access-only solution is a terminal that provides a user access to information with different security classifications while assuredly keeping the information separate.
