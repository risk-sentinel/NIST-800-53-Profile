  title 'System-wide Intrusion Detection System'
  desc <<~DESC
    Connect and configure individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system.
  DESC
  desc 'check', <<~CHECK
    Determine if:
      SI-04(01)[01] individual intrusion detection tools are connected to a system-wide intrusion detection system;
      SI-04(01)[02] individual intrusion detection tools are configured into a system-wide intrusion detection system.

    Assessment methods and objects:
      EXAMINE: System and information integrity policy; system and information integrity procedures; procedures addressing system monitoring tools and techniques; system design documentation; system monitoring tools and techniques documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit records; system security plan; other relevant documents or records
      INTERVIEW: System/network administrators; organizational personnel with information security responsibilities; organizational personnel installing, configuring, and/or maintaining the system; organizational personnel responsible for monitoring the system; organizational personnel responsible for the intrusion detection system
      TEST: Organizational processes for intrusion detection and system monitoring; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing intrusion detection capabilities
  CHECK
  desc 'fix', <<~FIX
    NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 and SP 800-53A Rev 5 publish no remediation text for this control. Implement the control statement above, record the implementation statement in the SSP, and replace this text with the system-specific remediation once the control is automated.
  FIX
  desc 'guidance', <<~GUIDANCE
    Linking individual intrusion detection tools into a system-wide intrusion detection system provides additional coverage and effective detection capabilities. The information contained in one intrusion detection tool can be shared widely across the organization, making the system-wide detection capability more robust and powerful.
